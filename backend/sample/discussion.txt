user flow
1. access website
2. read up on the neccessary flags needed in template (to clean up)
3. prepare excel template with desired flags
4. upload (single) template excel 
5. upload (mult) json files
6. choose template to link json data with
7. generate excel

flags
A - Table row/col fill up
  indicators
    !!> alias   - data moves to the right
    !!v alias   - data moves downwards
  sorting --> take first explored sorting in a given direction
    alias ++    - ASC
    alias --    - DESC
  overall
    !!(>|v) alias [++|--]

B - Single cell substitution
  ## alias      - single cell (if more than one such data exists, take first/any)

limitations
1. table must be separated by at least one empty cell spacing
2. flags must be present for parsing
3. for a single connected table, even if there are to be no data inputted, !!(v|>) flag is needed for correctness of data mapping
4. template provided must consider maximum number of rows specific json data might provide, i.e. no dynamic table expansion

discussion:
- user flow
- limitations
- scalability
- future works
- performance metrics (threading)
- code quality
